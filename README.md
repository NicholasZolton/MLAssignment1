# Running the Project

## Poetry

This project is using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). If you have poetry installed, simply use `poetry install` in the directory to handle setting up a virtual environment with all the dependencies.

Then, simply run `poetry run python ./mlassignment1/main.py` to run the project, or activate the virtual environment and then run `main.py` manually.

## Non-Poetry

If you would like to run the project without poetry, simply use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

Then, simply run `python ./mlassignment1/main.py` to run the project.
